Data analytics chatbot
This project is aimed at developing an AI powered data analytics chatbot to help students learn and apply data analytics techniques 
This chatbot is built using several powerful libraries such as pandas scipy statistics scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn plotly streamlit and many more
This provides an llm integration using the module Gemini
This bot will assist students in generating insights analytics performing statistical analysis visualizations and major understanding core ML functions 
Software use for this project 
Inorder to perform this project jupyter notebook cannot be used coz of this limited integrations instead tools like VS code as well as pycharm can be used to perform this project since it comes with various integrations 
In this project we will be moving forward with the VS code application 
Objectives: 
Interactive learning – It enables students to interact with various tools and receive real time codes as well as visualizations 
ML support – Assist in applying basic ML techniques or ML algorithms and help in evaluating models 
Visualizations – It can generate highly detailed visualizations and provide instant plots which can be used to understand the datasets 
Code snippets and explanation – The chatbot should provide various code snippets and explanations as per the users requirement in performing EDA statistical analysis as well as ML models 
NLP – With the use of Gemini llm the users can utilize the gpt to help with questions and detailed explanations 
Modules used for this project 
Backend:
•	Python fundamentals 
•	Numpy 
•	Pandas 
•	Matplotlib 
•	Seaborn 
•	Scipy 
•	Statistics 
•	Requests 
•	Scikit-learn (ML orientations) 
•	Plotly 

Frontend: 
•	Streamlit module 
•	NLP 
Gemini module (API) - For integrating GPT to handle more complex queries for better understanding 
Regex parsing – RE module – IT is used for reading user queries, extracting relevant data from datasets with complex queries using specific functions. 
Key features 
There are several key features which will be implemented using the modules and the software 
Some of those features are 
Data upload and handling – The users can upload datasets or files and the bot will display the first few rows as a preview and generate insights based on the query provided 
EDA – Users can request statistics visualizations and several other ML tools or functions 
Statistical Analysis – Users can fetch descriptive statistics as well as testing statistics 
ML Assistance – The user can build or utilize basic ML models such as supervised models or unsupervised models 
And also it provides and utilizes model evaluation techniques such as accuracy classification report and many more 
Gemini integration – If the user have some queries the gemini api can be utilized as gemini’s api can be used to generate human like responses 
Query parsing with regex – This bot can recognize patterns structures provided by the user such as several data queries as well as statistical queries 

Future improvements of the project 
The chatbot is limited to csv files but in the future excel json file formats and many other files can be integrated with this chatbot 
Advanced ML support include many ML algorithms such as random forest support vector and many more 
Enhanced NLP Implement advanced NLP techniques for queries 
Project workflow 
User interaction 
Users will interact with the chatbot with the help of streamlit interface by typing queries 
Query parsing – Now before generating results the query is recognised by basic keyword matching 
If the query is too advanced gemini’s api is invoke to provide the results according to the query and dataset 
Task execution – If the query relates to data handling relevant functions from pandas matplotlib seaborn and scipy are executed but if the query requires statistical analysis modules such as numpy scipy and scikit-learn will be utilized 
Response – The result of the query will be provided and displayed using the streamlit module inside the frontend part 
Inorder to establish a python environment or virtual environment inside the terminal this syntax is used 
Python -m venv venv
Gemini has limited usage 
Conclusion for the project 
This data analytics chatbot is created or developed using python fundamentals streamlit and most importantly gemini
It offers a comprehensive learning experience for students who are in the domain of data analytics as well as data science
With the help of several python modules the user has integrated visualizations statistics ML and NLP with the help of regex module 
This chatbot serves as an important educational tool which is dynamic and engaging 
This chatbot is powered by gemini 1.5 flash model llm to answer questions related to datasets 
This project contains all the fundamental concepts as well as some advance concepts which have been learnt and implemented over the course of time
